{"name":"guigouz","tagline":"","body":"\r\n```\r\ni write code\r\n```\r\n\r\nProjects i've been working on \r\n\r\n### Objectiveweb\r\nObjectiveweb allows a developer to define simple data domains and access them using a REST interface. The backend takes care of authorizing the request and data retrieval or persisting the data to multiple SQL tables.\r\n\r\n### Metaproject\r\nThe project aims to be a thin layer between the data (provided by a REST service) and the user interface. I was responsible for the library research, design and implementation. Currently I'm writing documentation, which is available as a web application on http://www.bravado.com.br/metaproject/compendium and preparing for a public release\r\n\r\nDespite being backend-independent, Metaproject complements Objectiveweb with an UI library, and most of its components came from real application requirements which are already in production.","google":"UA-40660605-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
